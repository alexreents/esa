      "I am currently double-majoring in economics and finance with a double minor in real estate and business analytics. I chose to major in Economics because I have an interest in using analytics reasoning to study behavioral patterns, policy, and various different business areas like finance, data analysis, or mathematics. The critical thinking skills a degree in economics gives you can be critical in helping you succeed and in developing useful skills in many fields.",

      "I like that economics implements a mix of mathematical and social scientific approaches to solve problems pertaining to various aspects of daily life such as health, labor, and trade. What I find especially meaningful about economics is that economic research and data can, and often does, influence public policy issues in a very direct manner. For example, during and after crises—whether they be natural or financial—the government and the public often look toward economists to issue evidence-based advice that will mitigate any potential economic fallout caused by the sudden instability. Such instances show how necessary the field of economics is to individual, national, and global welfare.\n\n In my free time, I like to watch documentaries on topics such as travel, technology, and economics.",

      "I chose economics because it gives me the opportunity to learn about business and human interaction with goods and services from a more theoretical perspective. This background then allows me to go explore many different fields and specialize in any topic I’m interested in. I love learning about economic development and can see myself doing something in that field in the future. In my free time, I love swimming, trying out new restaurants, playing tennis, and going on different adventures around the bay area.",

      "Hello! I’ll be working as the Economics Students Association Treasurer for the 2020-2021 school year. I am currently a Junior double majoring in Economics with a Data Analysis concentration and Political Science with a Pre-Law emphasis. I chose to pursue a degree in Economics because of how versatile and widely applicable the concepts are to other academic domains and I am particularly interested in microeconomic theory, econometrics, and data visualization within the field. In my free time, I love to read and spend time outdoors by going on hikes around the Bay Area!",
